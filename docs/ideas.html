  <h2 id="code-world">CodeWorld projects<a class="anchor" href="#code-world">üîó</a></h2>
  <p>Chris Smith has kindly provided funding for two students to work on the <a href="http://code.world">CodeWorld</a> project.</p>
<p>CodeWorld is an educational environment using a variant of Haskell. It provides a simple mathematical model for geometric figures, animations, and interactive and multi-player games. The web-based programming environment supports this educational mission with a zero-setup editor and compiler, easy sharing and cloud storage of projects, and the ability to run programs right in the web browser using GHCJS.</p>
<p>The list of ideas for CodeWorld can be found <a href="https://github.com/google/codeworld/blob/master/SummerOfHaskell.md">here</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="galois-cabal">Last Mile for `cabal new-build`<a class="anchor" href="#galois-cabal">üîó</a></h2>
  <p>Cabal‚Äôs <code>new-build</code> system has help solved many of the problems that plagued Haskell development for years. You can read an introduction to <code>cabal new-build</code> on <a href="http://blog.ezyang.com/2016/05/announcing-cabal-new-build-nix-style-local-builds/">Edward Yang‚Äôs blog</a> While the work is exciting it is not quite ready for prime-time.</p>
<p>The project is looking for an intrepid Haskeller that is willing to help get <code>cabal new-build</code> out the door. More specifically the project aims to help port some of the commands from standard <code>cabal</code> that have not been ported yet, many of which are kept track of with <a href="https://github.com/haskell/cabal/milestone/42">this <code>cabal</code> issue</a>.</p>
<p>Ideally, a candidate hoping to work on this project will have some experience with <code>cabal</code>, but we understand that the Summer of Haskell is for learning too :)</p>

  <h2 id="galois-ghc">GHC Performance<a class="anchor" href="#galois-ghc">üîó</a></h2>
  <p>Love <code>ghc</code>? Think you can make it faster?</p>
<p>This project has the aim of improving the performance of <code>ghc</code>. As the language that <code>ghc</code> accepts has become more intricate the compiler has seen a slowdown in compile times. This is a known problem with several paths forward: <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Performance/Compiler">GHC-Wiki page on performance</a></p>
<p>The ideal candidate will have some experience with developing on <code>ghc</code>. That being said, we understand that the Summer of Haskell is also about learning.</p>

  <h2 id="hadrian-ghc">Improve the Shake-Based Hadrian Build System for GHC<a class="anchor" href="#hadrian-ghc">üîó</a></h2>
  <p>Advance the Hadrian build system to the point that it can replace the existing GHC build system in practice, including specifically adding support for cross compilation, source and binary distribution generation, dynamic way, and test suite support. Most of these issues are detailed in the ‚ÄúCurrent Limitations‚Äù section of the <a href="https://github.com/snowleopard/hadrian/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a></p>
<p>This project may well entail working further on the Shake tool itself to increase its featureset as a prerequisite for use of these features in hadrian.</p>

  <h2 id="linear-streaming">Safe streaming with linear types<a class="anchor" href="#linear-streaming">üîó</a></h2>
  <p>Proposed solution to the problem of writing safe and efficient have abounded since Kiselyov <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-29822-6_15">argued against lazy IO</a>.</p>
<p>Streaming libraries are typically of one of two kind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safe at their core at the cost of expressiveness: such library model stream transformers rather than stream. They often also provide unsafe escape hatches for the cases where the model is too restrictive. The <code>conduit</code> library is of that form.</li>
<li>Expressive, by modelling streams as first-class objects, but unsafe. Such library embraces the fact that the escape hatches are the key to expressiveness and place them at the core of their model. The <code>streaming</code> library is of that form.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project consists in adapting the <a href="https://www.stackage.org/lts-8.6/package/streaming-0.1.4.5"><code>streaming</code></a> library, so that it leverages the features of a prototype <a href="https://github.com/tweag/ghc/tree/linear-types">version of GHC that includes support for linear types</a> in order to make it safe.</p>
<p>The key observation is that the unsafety of <code>streaming</code> is precisely one of linearity (or, rather, lack thereof), a linear version of <code>streaming</code> would have essentially the same feel as the existing, unsafe, library. Nonetheless, the modifications and additions to the <code>streaming</code> API to cope with linearity will require significant implementation and design effort.</p>

  <h2 id="liquid-haskell-base">Verify base using Liquid Haskell to ensure totality of functions<a class="anchor" href="#liquid-haskell-base">üîó</a></h2>
  <p>The base contains many partial functions that are poorly documented. Liquid Haskell can be used to verify that all functions are total (by restricting the domain of the functions input with refinement types).</p>
<p>Though Liquid Haksell comes with <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell/tree/develop/include">some speficiations for base</a>, these specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>are not checked against the base implementations and</li>
<li>are not part of the base libraries.</li>
</ul>
