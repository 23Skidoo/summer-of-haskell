<p>haskell.org has participated in the Google Summer of Code for the last several years. Sadly, this year we were not accepted into the program. Rather than risk the supply of mentors and students drying up, we've resolved to try to go it on our own for a summer.</p>

<p>We're following the same general guidelines as the Google Summer of Code:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must be at least 18 years of age.</li>
<li>You must be a full or part-time student at an accredited university (or have been accepted as of April 22, 2017).</li>
<li>You must be eligible to work in the country you will reside in during the program.</li>
<li>You must reside in a country that is not currently embargoed by the United States.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you aren't sure if these conditions apply, please <a href="./contact.html">contact us</a></p>
