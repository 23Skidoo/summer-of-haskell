      <h1>Getting ready for Summer of Haskell 2017</h1>
<p>
  Posted on <em>April  5, 2017</em> by <em>Niki Vazou & Jasper Van der Jeugt</em> (<a href="../news/2017-04-05-getting-ready.html">permalink</a>)
</p>
<p>We are happy to announce that Summer of Haskell 2017 will host at least 8 students, funded from the Haskell community and corporate sponsors.</p>
<p>You can find all information (including the timeline) at the Summer of Haskell new webpage:</p>
<p><a href="https://summer.haskell.org/" class="uri">https://summer.haskell.org/</a></p>
<p>Students can submit applications from April 25th until the May 6th. We recommend that interested students start thinking about their proposals and brainstorm with potential mentors. In case you would like to participate as a student but you have no idea what to work on, we have a page dedicated to ideas here:</p>
<p><a href="https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html" class="uri">https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html</a></p>
<p>Teachers of FP courses at universities around the world are strongly encouraged to share this announcement with their students.</p>
<p>Mentors, as well as everyone from the community, is encouraged to contribute ideas by sending pull requests to the Summer of Haskell repository (or contacting us):</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/haskell-org/summer-of-haskell" class="uri">https://github.com/haskell-org/summer-of-haskell</a></p>
<p>Sponsors are still welcome, as we can add more slots if the necessary funds become available. Combining our current individual donations with partial sponsors, we only need $2000 more to fund an additional student. Please consider making a small donation towards that goal. If you would like to contribute do not hesitate to contact us or donate directly:</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Donate_to_Haskell.org" class="uri">https://wiki.haskell.org/Donate_to_Haskell.org</a></p>
<p>We’d like to thank our current sponsors for making this Summer of Haskell possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://haskell.org">haskell.org</a> kicked things off this year by funding a student and organizing the Summer of Haskell 2017 after a successful <a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2016-December/125702.html">Summer of Haskell 2016</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://asahi-net.jp/en/">Asahi Net</a> is a Japanese Internet service provider that has been running stable systems for over 25 years. They are a proud sponsor of the Summer of Haskell, and contribute to the Japanese Haskell community.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.awakenetworks.com/">Awake Networks</a> is building a next generation network security and analytics platform. They are a proud sponsor of the Summer of Haskell and contribute broadly to the Haskell community.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://code.world/">CodeWorld</a> is an educational project that blends mathematics and Haskell programming into a visual playground. Chris Smith has volunteered to fund two students to work on CodeWorld in particular.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> uses Haskell in its <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/745068642270222/fighting-spam-with-haskell/">anti-abuse infrastructure</a>, and as part of that effort we open-sourced the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/Haxl">Haxl</a> framework which is being used at scale in production to automatically parallelise data-fetching code. We’re delighted to be able to support the Haskell community’s efforts by sponsoring a student for this year’s Summer of Haskell.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://fugue.co/">Fugue Inc.</a> radically simplifies cloud operations with its software-defined system for dynamically orchestrating and enforcing cloud infrastructure at scale. Fugue uses Haskell in its product and is proud to sponsor a student to improve the ecosystem.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://galois.com/">Galois</a> applies cutting-edge computer science and applied mathematics to solve difficult technological problems, delivering practical solutions tailored to our clients’ needs. Haskell and other functional programming languages are key tools we use in providing these solutions.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://tweag.io">Tweag I/O</a> is a network of software innovation labs across Europe. We develop novel solutions and products for our clients around the world. Haskell is key to delivering fast, correct and maintainable code. We have shipped Haskell in anything from tiny web services to large high-performance compute clusters with custom hardware. We’re particularly keen to help the community grow Haskell into the strongest systems programming language and ecosystem out there. We’re very proud to sponsor a student this summer to help make it happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, Davean has volunteered to fund a student expressly to work on the <a href="../ideas.html#hadrian-ghc">Hadrian build system for GHC</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to contact us at (nvazou at cs.umd.edu and m at jaspervdj.be) if want to help or if you have any ideas, questions, or concerns.</p>
<p>Best, Niki Vazou &amp; Jasper Van der Jeugt for the Haskell.org Committee</p>
