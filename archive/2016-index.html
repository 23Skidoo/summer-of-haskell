	<h1>Summer of Haskell 2016</h1>
	<p>The Summer of Haskell is an effort by haskell.org to reach out to students and encourage them to contribute to the Haskell community with the aid of experienced mentors.</p>
	<p>This program is open to college students, 18 or older, in most countries.</p>
	<p>The general structure of our program is set up to mirror the Google Summer of Code.</p>
	<p>Participation in the Summer of Haskell represents a similar level of commitment to taking a job or internship for the summer in terms of time investment. The compensation for accepted student projects is 5500 USD, to be paid in two lump sums, half at the beginning of the summer, and half upon receiving a passing midterm evaluation. As with the Google Summer Of Code, participation in the Summer of Haskell is not an internship or employment but simply an activity that the student performs as an independent developer for which he/she is paid a stipend.</p>

	<div class="question">
	  <h1>Why are we doing this rather than simply participating in the Google Summer of Code?</h1>
	  <p>haskell.org has participated in the Google Summer of Code for the last several years. Sadly, this year we were not accepted into the program. Rather than risk the supply of mentors and students drying up, we've resolved to try to go it on our own for a summer.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
	  <h1>Am I elegible to participate as a student?</h1>
	  <p>We're following the same general guidelines as the Google Summer of Code:
	    <br />
	    <ul>
	      <li>You must be at least 18 years of age</li>
	      <li>You must be a full or part-time student at an accredited university (or have been accepted as of April 22, 2016)</li>
	      <li>You must be eligible to work in the country you will reside in during the program</li>
	      <li>You must reside in a country that is not currently embargoed by the United States.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <br />
