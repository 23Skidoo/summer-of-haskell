title: 'Call for Ideas for 2018'

Google Summer of Code [will take place again in 2018][1]. Last year, Haskell.org
was not selected, and we decided to [run our own program][2], which ended very
[successfully][3].

This year, we would like to apply to Google Summer of Code again, since their
sponsorship is very significant.  The main feedback we received last year was
that we didnâ€™t really have a great homepage for Summer of Code with ideas for
students (things were very rushed and we ended up submitting a link to an
outdated bug tracker -- not ideal!).

We already started fixing that last year by building a [nicer webpage to host
ideas][4].  We would now like to call on the community to submit ideas for the
students.

If you are the maintainer or the user of a Haskell project, and you have an
improvement in mind which a student could work on during the summer, please
submit an idea here:

<https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html>

Or contact Niki Vazou (nvazou [AT] cs.umd.edu) or myself (m [AT] jaspervdj.be)
directly.

For context, Google Summer of Code is a program where Google sponsors students
to work on open-source projects during the summer.  Haskell.org has taken part
in this program from 2006 until 2015.  Many important improvements to the
ecosystem have been the direct or indirect result of Google Summer of Code
projects, and it has also connected new people with the existing community.

Projects should benefit as many people as possible -- e.g. an improvement to GHC
will benefit more people than an update to a specific library or tool, but both
are definitely valid.  New libraries and applications written in Haskell, rather
than improvements to existing ones, are also accepted.  Projects should be
concrete and small enough in scope such that they can be finished by a student
in three months.
