We wanted to let folks know what happened with all our Summer of Haskell
projects, and thank again all those who donated as individuals or sponsored
students to make this possible. As a reminder, the accepted projects were
announced on reddit at:

* * *

1. Native Metaprogramming in Haskell

    This very ambitious project made significant progress, though is not
    yet ready for a full merge into GHC. A talk and paper on work relating
    to it were presented at the Haskell Implementors Workshop at ICFP, and
    a page on the GHC wiki describes the current status.

    - https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/NativeMetaprogramming

2. GHCVM - A JVM Backend for GHC

    Again, significant progress made on a very ambitious project, which has now
    been renamed to “eta”. A talk on the work done was given at the HIW, and the
    project is considered ready for “hobbyist use”.

3. Completing the LLVM backend for Accelerate

    All operators of the LLVM backend are now implemented, and we’re told that
    the accelerate-llvm project, already usable, will be get a more proper
    announcement as ready for widespread use real soon now (tm).

4. Hackage Improvements

    A whole raft of usability improvements to hackage (including the
    long-awaited rollout of reverse dependency tracking, and a very usable
    package browser interface) are undergoing final code review and polish in a
    PR before being rolled out. The student’s blog contains more information
    about what’s on the way.

5. Derivable Storable and Prim instances

    This work resulted in both a package (usable today) and a plugin to improve
    the performance of the derived code. Updates on the decisions made and work
    done were posted to the numerical-haskell group

    - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/numericalhaskell

6. Visual functional block-based programming language for CodeWorld

    This work went well and is described on the student’s blog. It is usable
    today at https://code.world/blocks and apparently has already begun to be
    integrated into CodeWorld lesson plans.

7. Jupyter for GHCJS

    Apparently this ran into a far amount of difficulties and didn’t make
    significant progress, though not for lack of effort. The student is
    anticipated to write up an experience report describing some of the problems
    encountered and how others might work around them in the future.

8. Live Profiling and Performance Monitoring Server

    A lot of work was accomplished on various fronts here. A number of
    changes to the GHC RTS are in review and pending merge. A tool has
    been written to take advantage of the newly available information. And
    various other small packages that met needs along the way were
    extracted and contributed to hackage. A fuller write-up of progress
    and future work is available at the student’s blog.

Apologies for the delays in assembling this information -- as they say, man
plans, the fates laugh.

Thanks to all our students for their dedicated work and contributions to the
ecosystem. We hope to see much more from all of you in the future. And thanks to
all our mentors for donating their time to guide, teach, and make this possible.

And a very special thanks to Edward Kmett for co-ordinating much of the
administrative work here, as well as fundraising towards this great Summer of
Haskell.
