Dear Haskellers,

We are sorry to announce that this year Haskell.org <http://haskell.org/> was
not accepted for the 2017 Google Summer of Code.  But, as last year, we plan to
organize our own Summer of Haskell!

We ask for your help to plan a successful Summer of Haskell 2017. As last year,
one student will be funded directly out of Haskell.org <http://haskell.org/>
general funds. The key factor in how many further students we can fund is the
generosity and support of donors. Funding a single student plus overhead costs
6000 USD. We are looking for donors willing to cover half, one or more students.
If you (or your organization) are interested in becoming a Summer of Haskell
donor please reach out to committee at haskell.org. We also encourage you to
make a smaller donation, as if we receive enough of small donations in total, we
will combine them to fund more students.

Donation information is at:

<https://wiki.haskell.org/Donate_to_Haskell.org>

More information will be forthcoming as we work out the details.

Feel free to contact us at (nvazou at cs.umd.edu and m at jaspervdj.be) if want
to help or if you have any ideas, questions, or concerns.

Best,

Niki Vazou & Jasper Van der Jeugt  
for the Haskell.org Committee
