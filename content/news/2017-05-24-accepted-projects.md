We would like to thank all students who applied for the quality proposals.  We
received 68 so selecting the projects was extremely difficult.  Yet, three new
positions opened during selection period to accept high quality applications.

Summer of Haskell 2017 is made possible by our generous sponsors:

- [haskell.org](http://haskell.org) kicked things off this year by funding a
  student and organizing the Summer of Haskell 2017 after a successful
  [Summer of Haskell 2016](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2016-December/125702.html).

- [Asahi Net](https://asahi-net.jp/en/) is a Japanese Internet service provider that
  has been running stable systems for over 25 years.  They are a proud sponsor of
  the Summer of Haskell, and contribute to the Japanese Haskell community.

- [Awake Networks](http://www.awakenetworks.com/) is building a next generation
  network security and analytics platform.  They are a proud sponsor of the Summer
  of Haskell and contribute broadly to the Haskell community.

- [CodeWorld](http://code.world/) is an educational project that blends
  mathematics and Haskell programming into a visual playground.  Chris Smith has
  volunteered to fund two students to work on CodeWorld in particular.

- [Digital Asset](http://digitalasset.com/) provides Distributed Ledger solutions
  for financial institutions globally. They have developed a pure, typed,
  functional, domain specific language for writing contracts, called DAML.  They
  are a proud sponsor of the Summer of Haskell and contribute broadly to the
  Haskell community.

- [Facebook](http://facebook.com/) uses Haskell in its
  [anti-abuse infrastructure](https://code.facebook.com/posts/745068642270222/fighting-spam-with-haskell/),
  and as part of that effort we open-sourced the
  [Haxl](https://github.com/facebook/Haxl) framework which is being used at scale
  in production to automatically parallelise data-fetching code.  We're delighted
  to be able to support the Haskell community's efforts by sponsoring a student
  for this year's Summer of Haskell.

- [Fugue Inc.](http://fugue.co/) radically simplifies cloud operations with its
  software-defined system for dynamically orchestrating and enforcing cloud
  infrastructure at scale.  Fugue uses Haskell in its product and is proud to
  sponsor a student to improve the ecosystem.

- [Galois](http://galois.com/) applies cutting-edge computer science and applied
  mathematics to solve difficult technological problems, delivering practical
  solutions tailored to our clients’ needs.  Haskell and other functional
  programming languages are key tools we use in providing these solutions.

- [IOHK](https://iohk.io/) is a technology company committed to using
  peer-to-peer technologies to provide financial services to the three billion
  people who don't have them.  We implement our first-principles cryptographic
  research in Haskell and we are committed to the development of the Haskell
  ecosystem.

- [Tweag I/O](http://tweag.io) is a network of software innovation labs across
  Europe. We develop novel solutions and products for our clients around the
  world. Haskell is key to delivering fast, correct and maintainable code. We
  have shipped Haskell in anything from tiny web services to large
  high-performance compute clusters with custom hardware. We're particularly
  keen to help the community grow Haskell into the strongest systems programming
  language and ecosystem out there. We're very proud to sponsor a student this
  summer to help make it happen.

Davean has volunteered to fund a student expressly to work on the [Hadrian build
system for GHC](/ideas.html#hadrian-ghc). Steven Keuchel has provided funds for
a student to work on Haskey.
