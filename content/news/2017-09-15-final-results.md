Hey all,

The Summer of Haskell 2017 is officially over! 
We want to thank the students, mentors and sponsors for the great and productive summer. 

Getting ready for the next Summer of Haskell, if you have any project suggestions/ideas send us 
a pull request in the [summer-of-haskell repo](https://github.com/haskell-org/summer-of-haskell)
or just an email (m@jaspervdj.be & nvazou@cs.umd.edu). 

Here are the students' experiences of Summer of Haskell 2017.

1.  Safe streaming with linear types  
    Student: Edvard HÃ¼binette  
    Mentor: Arnaud Spiwack
    Status: Completed
    Link: <https://github.com/m0ar/safe-streaming#list-of-interesting-parts-to-check-out>
    
    "The unsafety that arose from implicitly repeated effects when accessing 
    old stream states was resolved neatly by making the streams linear. 
    To make this possible, linear counterparts of the functor/applicative/monad stack was developed.
    A major discovery of the project was that the price we paid for safe streams is the absence of 
    take-like operations; an important part of the programming model.
    
    Since this project requires a pre-alpha version of the GHC compiler,
    the main focus after the safety issues were resolved shifted to communication 
    and documentation of the experience of developing with linear type systems; 
    indeed a very interesting experience! Through this opportunity I have learned an incredible lot,
    gotten in touch with fantastic people in the industry, and gotten the opportunity to share 
    my findings with an interested community; all of which have been awesome."


2.  Bringing Sanity to the GHC Performance Test-Suite  
    Student: Jared Weakly  
    Mentor: Ben Gamari  
    Status: Completed
    Link: <https://jaredweakly.com/blog/category/blog/>
    
    "The experience was great! 
    I learned a lot about doing real work on real code 
    (y'know, the old creaky code of nightmares where you can't just start over "the right way" like you do in school projects).
    My blog jaredweakly.com goes over a lot more detail than I can provide here 
    but it's safe to say that I loved this first experience of giving back to the Haskell
    community which has helped me out so much and given me a language I deeply enjoy."

3.  Haskell IDE Engine  
    Student: Zubin Duggal  
    Mentor: Alan Zimmerman
    Status: Completed
    Link: <https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine>

    "I had a lot of fun working on this HSOC. 
    I got the chance to work on trying to fix a key issue in the Haskell ecosystem - editor integration and 
    IDE-like functionality. 
    HIE is now starting to be used in the wild, and it feels good to work on something useful to other people. 
    This also wouldn't have been possible without the guidance of my mentor, Alan Zimmerman."

4.  Last Mile for cabal new-build  
    Student: Francesco Gazzetta  
    Mentor: Daniel Wagner
    Status: In Progress 
    Link: <<https://github.com/haskell/cabal/projects/4/>
    
    "Working on an open source project so widely used by the community was amazing! 
    Here's a brief summary of what has been done:
      * new-build and new-test were already done when I started
      * new-run
      * same functionality as old-run, plus new-build target syntax
      * also makes data-files work in new-build projects
      * new-bench
      * new-exec (is in the process of being merged)
      * new-install (part of it, which includes the "cabal new-install some-hackage-package" usecase. I'm currently polishing it)"

5.  Totality checking base with Liquid Haskell  
    Student: Sean Leffler  
    Mentor: Niki Vazou  
    Co-mentor: Eric Seidel
    Status: In Progress
    Link: <https://github.com/sdleffler/ghc/tree/ghc-8.0>
    
    "I found working with Liquid Haskell to be simple and mostly intuitive! 
    No bugs in the standard library were found in the course of the project 
    (although what I did manage to verify was a tiny fraction of what I would have liked to.) 
    We did, however, find several minor bugs and one major bug in Liquid Haskell, 
    and I learned a lot about the inner workings of Liquid Haskell. 
    I was personally fascinated by the limits of Liquid with respect to sometimes 
    being unable to automatically inductively reason about datatypes 
    (e.g. the inability to infer that a list of uninhabited types cannot be nonempty.) 
    In any case, this project has firmly reassured me in my belief that few projects have any excuse not 
    to Liquify their Haskell."


6.  Modularizing haskell-mode and improving haskell-interactive-mode  
    Student: Vasantha Ganesh Kanniappan  
    Mentor: Gracjan Polak
    Status: In Progress
    Link: <https://blog.hustlr.in/posts/2017-08-07-Wrapping-up-HSoC-2017.html>
    
    "We were able to retain almost all of the features and simultaneously 
    reduce more than 4000 lines of code. We were able to merge parts of that change, 
    but the most important PR is controversial and might not get merged. 
    This is because of the removal of a feature that supports the ability to use more 
    than one session of inferior haskell process per Emacs process. 
    Although with the new change, people can create a new Emacs process to use a new session, 
    many people are not happy about it."

7.  Haskey (an embedded key-value store modeled after LMDB)  
    Student: Henri Verroken  
    Mentor: Steven Keuchel  
    Co-mentor: George Karachalias
    Status: Completed
    Link: <https://deliquus.com>
    
    "It was a great opportunity to be a part of the Summer of Haskell project. 
    It was challenging, but extremely interesting. 
    I learned a lot, not only about database internals, 
    but also on advanced Haskell concepts as well. I got a lot of advice and guidance from my mentor, 
    which really helped me out. Short, I loved working on Haskey this past summer."

8.  Improve the Shake-Based Hadrian Build System for GHC  
    Student: Zhen Zhang  
    Mentor: Andrey Mokhov
    Status: Completed
    Link: <https://github.com/izgzhen/hadrian-soh17-notes>
    
    "The experience is very nice. The mentor Andrey was very patient and supportive. 
    Although hacking on a build system might not always be super productive, 
    and things are broken by the upstream GHC updates often, 
    we understand the situation and work together to solve the more prioritized issues. 
    From what we have achieved in the summer (my work includes all three milestones, including dynamic way, 
    install rule, and cross compilation), I think Hadrian project has reached the stage where we can seriously 
    talking about being merged into the GHC. It is very exciting."
    

9. Improvement of Hackage Matrix Builder  
    Student: Andika Demas Riyandi  
    Mentor: Herbert Valerio Riedel
    Status: In Progress

    "Being able to participate in the HSOC and having great mentor is more than enough 
    for student to learn functional programming (especially Haskell). 
    During my time working on the project, I have learned so many things and found great community 
    (both Purescript and Haskell community) to discuss whenever my mentor is not available."

10. WebGHC (a WebAssembly backend for GHC)  
    Student: Michael Vogelsang  
    Mentor: Will Fancher
    Status: In Progress
    Link: <https://webghc.github.io/2017/08/10/hsocwrapup.html>
    
    "I was immensely glad WebGHC was accepted into the program, 
    and thankful to be partnered with an extremely knowledgeable and helpful mentor. 
    This project sits at an interesting crossroads of compilation toolchains, web technology, and functional programming.
    Over the course of the summer we had deal with issues originating from GHC's buildsystem and LLVM backend, 
    LLVM/Clang itself, WebAssembly proper, individual browser behavior, and more.
    
    Needless to say, I gained a lot of knowledge about a wide variety of subjects over the course of the summer, 
    and when I needed help I was often able to turn to the Haskell or LLVM community. 
    I was surprised to find out firsthand just how quickly the GHC and LLVM dev teams respond to 
    bug submissions with meaningful and helpful feedback while managing such big projects.
    
    I'm grateful for the role the Summer of Haskell has played in getting this project off the ground
    and I plan to continue working on this project in the long term. 
    Sometime in the near future, I expect WebGHC to be producing production-ready, 
    performant code for the Web."

code.world projects
--------------------

11. Better collaborative coding features for CodeWorld
    Student: Parv Mor
    Co-mentor: Michael Chavinda
    Co-mentor: Anthony Green
    Status: Completed
    Link: <https://github.com/parvmor/codeworld>
    
    "Summer of Haskell was one of the greatest experience towards functional programming 
    and taught me a great lot of things. During the work period I introduced several new 
    features (like a new file system, ability to comment over projects, ability to work 
    on the same project together i.e. simultaneous coding, etc) for codeworld. 
    I hope to see users using this new features effectively."

12. Improvements to parsing, compiling, and errors for CodeWorld
    Student: Pranjal Tale
    Primary Mentor: Kyle Butt
    Secondary Mentor: Chris Smith
    Status: Completed
    Link: <https://pranjaltale16.github.io/static/codeWorldSummerOfHaskell.pdf>
        
    "My aim for the summer was to add a bunch of features in CodeWorld. 
    This included small features (like shifting error sanitizer to haskell, 
    shifting it into a separate cabal project to filter runtime errors, etc.) 
    to some major features (writing standalone cabal for compilation, 
    adding testcases for the same, etc).
    Apart from this, I also planned to fix some bugs that were discovered during 
    the Summer of Haskell period mainly because I was expecting some bugs to come up. 
    Although, most of my time was spent in adding features itself.
    
    The past few months have been great working with CodeWorld! 
    I learned a lot of new things about various technologies and gained a lot of exposure. 
    I had been a bit active in open source before, but working with CodeWorld and my mentors 
    gave me a far more better experience in the open source world than what I had been involved in previously. 
    I still plan to contribute to CodeWorld after Summer of Haskell ends, and possibly learn a lot more!"


13. Exporting and sharing CodeWorld projects
    Student: Venkatraman Srikanth
    Primary Mentor: Theo Belaire
    Secondary Mentor: Han Wang
    Status: In progress
    Link: <https://github.com/google/codeworld/pull/545>
    
    "CodeWorld users can now export their projects to video. 
    Exporting to Android apps is currently under review and will be rolled out soon.
    
    I couldn't meet all of the initial project goals, but I will continue to work on it. 
    This was a great learning experience!"

14. Improve editor tooling for CodeWorld
    Student: Eric Roberts
    Primary Mentor: Emin Karayel
    Secondary Mentor: Fernando Alegre    
    Status: In Progress
    Link: <https://github.com/google/codeworld/pull/509>
    
    "My project for Summer of Haskell was to improve the tooling for pictures in Codeworld. 
    My proposal involved adding a "debug mode" feature to inspect generated pictures, including showing source locations. 
    The end result was an interface that allows pieces of an picture to be selected and to show corresponding source 
    locations and properties of each piece."

We thank again all the participants for the great summer and look forward for Summer of Haskell 2018!
