GHC Performance
===============

Love `ghc`? Think you can make it faster?

This project has the aim of improving the performance of `ghc`. As the language that `ghc` accepts
has become more intricate the compiler has seen a slowdown in compile times. This is a known problem
with several paths forward:

The ideal candidate will have some experience with developing on `ghc`. That being said, we
understand that the Summer of Haskell is also about learning.
