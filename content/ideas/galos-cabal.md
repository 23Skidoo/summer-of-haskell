title: Last Mile for `cabal new-build`
---

Cabal's `new-build` system has help solved many of the problems that plagued Haskell
development for years. You can read an introduction to `cabal new-build` on
[Edward Yang's blog](http://blog.ezyang.com/2016/05/announcing-cabal-new-build-nix-style-local-builds/)
While the work is exciting it is not quite ready for prime-time.

The project is looking for an intrepid Haskeller that is willing to help get `cabal new-build`
out the door. More specifically the project aims to help port some of the commands from standard
`cabal` that have not been ported yet, many of which are kept track of with
[this `cabal` issue](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/milestone/42).

Ideally, a candidate hoping to work on this project will have some experience with `cabal`, but we understand
that the Summer of Haskell is for learning too :)

**Mentor:** Someone at Galois, Inc.
