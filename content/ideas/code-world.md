title: CodeWorld projects
---

Chris Smith has kindly provided funding for two students to work on the
[CodeWorld](http://code.world) project.

CodeWorld is an educational environment using a variant of Haskell. It provides
a simple mathematical model for geometric figures, animations, and interactive
and multi-player games. The web-based programming environment supports this
educational mission with a zero-setup editor and compiler, easy sharing and
cloud storage of projects, and the ability to run programs right in the web
browser using GHCJS.

The list of ideas for CodeWorld can be found
[here](https://github.com/google/codeworld/blob/master/SummerOfHaskell.md).
