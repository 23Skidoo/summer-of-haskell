# Introduction

The Summer of Haskell is an effort by haskell.org to reach out to students and
encourage them to contribute to the Haskell community with the aid of
experienced mentors.

This program is open to college students, 18 or older, in most countries.

The general structure of our program is set up to mirror the Google Summer of
Code.

Participation in the Summer of Haskell represents a similar level of commitment
to taking a job or internship for the summer in terms of time investment. The
compensation for accepted student projects is 5500 USD, to be paid in two lump
sums, half at the beginning of the summer, and half upon receiving a passing
midterm evaluation. As with the Google Summer Of Code, participation in the
Summer of Haskell is not an internship or employment but simply an activity that
the student performs as an independent developer for which he/she is paid a
stipend.

[haskell.org](http://haskell.org) kicked things off this year by funding a
student and organizing the Summer of Haskell 2017 after a successful [Summer of
Haskell 2016](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2016-December/125702.html).

[Asahi Net](http://asahinet.com/) is a Japanese Internet service provider that
has been running stable systems for over 25 years.  They are a proud sponsor of
the Summer of Haskell, and contribute to the Japanese Haskell community.

[CodeWorld](http://code.world/) is an educational project that blends
mathematics and Haskell programming into a visual playground.  Chris Smith has
volunteered to fund two students to work on CodeWorld in particular.

[Facebook](http://facebook.com/) uses Haskell in its [anti-abuse
infrastructure](https://code.facebook.com/posts/745068642270222/fighting-spam-with-haskell/),
and as part of that effort we open-sourced the
[Haxl](https://github.com/facebook/Haxl) framework which is being used at scale
in production to automatically parallelise data-fetching code.  We're delighted
to be able to support the Haskell community's efforts by sponsoring a student
for this year's Summer of Haskell.

[Fugue Inc.](http://fugue.co/) radically simplifies cloud operations with its
software-defined system for dynamically orchestrating and enforcing cloud
infrastructure at scale.  Fugue uses Haskell in its product and is proud to
sponsor a student to improve the ecosystem.

[Galois](http://galois.com/) applies cutting-edge computer science and applied
mathematics to solve difficult technological problems, delivering practical
solutions tailored to our clientsâ€™ needs.  Haskell and other functional
programming languages are key tools we use in providing these solutions.

[Tweag I/O](http://tweag.io) is a network of software innovation labs across
Europe. We develop novel solutions and products for our clients around the
world. Haskell is key to delivering fast, correct and maintainable code. We have
shipped Haskell in anything from tiny web services to large high-performance
compute clusters with custom hardware. We're particularly keen to help the
community grow Haskell into the strongest systems programming language and
ecosystem out there. We're very proud to sponsor a student this summer to help
make it happen.

Davean has volunteered to fund a student expressly to work on the [Hadrian build
system for GHC](/ideas.html#hadrian-ghc).
