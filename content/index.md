# Introduction

The Summer of Haskell is an effort by haskell.org to reach out to students and
encourage them to contribute to the Haskell community with the aid of
experienced mentors.

This program is open to college students, 18 or older, in most countries.

The general structure of our program is set up to mirror the Google Summer of
Code.

Participation in the Summer of Haskell represents a similar level of commitment
to taking a job or internship for the summer in terms of time investment. The
compensation for accepted student projects is 5500 USD, to be paid in two lump
sums, half at the beginning of the summer, and half upon receiving a passing
midterm evaluation. As with the Google Summer Of Code, participation in the
Summer of Haskell is not an internship or employment but simply an activity that
the student performs as an independent developer for which he/she is paid a
stipend.
