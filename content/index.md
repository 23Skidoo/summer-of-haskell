# Introduction

The Summer of Haskell is an effort by haskell.org to reach out to students and
encourage them to contribute to the Haskell community with the aid of
experienced mentors.

This program is open to college students, 18 or older, in most countries.

The general structure of our program is set up to mirror the Google Summer of
Code.

Participation in the Summer of Haskell represents a similar level of commitment
to taking a job or internship for the summer in terms of time investment. The
compensation for accepted student projects is 5500 USD, to be paid in two lump
sums, half at the beginning of the summer, and half upon receiving a passing
midterm evaluation. As with the Google Summer Of Code, participation in the
Summer of Haskell is not an internship or employment but simply an activity that
the student performs as an independent developer for which he/she is paid a
stipend.

[haskell.org](http://haskell.org) kicked things off this year by funding a
student and organizing the Summer of Haskell 2017 after a successful [Summer of
Haskell 2016](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2016-December/125702.html).

[Asahi Net](http://asahinet.com/) is a Japanese Internet service provider that
has been running stable systems for over 25 years.  They are a proud sponsor of
the Summer of Haskell, and contribute to the Japanese Haskell community.

[CodeWorld](http://code.world/) is an educational project that blends
mathematics and Haskell programming into a visual playground.  Chris Smith has
volunteered to fund two students to work on CodeWorld in particular.

[Fugue Inc.](http://fugue.co/) radically simplifies cloud operations with its
software-defined system for dynamically orchestrating and enforcing cloud
infrastructure at scale.  Fugue uses Haskell in its product and is proud to
sponsor a student to improve the ecosystem.

Davean has volunteered to fund a student expressly to work on the [Hadrian build
system for GHC](/ideas.html#hadrian-ghc).
